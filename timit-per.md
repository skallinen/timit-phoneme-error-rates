**MACHINE LEARNING** | **SPEECH RECOGNITION** | **DEEP LEARNING**

This is a simple excersize to illustrate the advances in machine learning regarding speech recognition. The TIMIT corpus was chosen as it was first published in 1988 and therefore there is some historical data to compare to.


The data has been manually collected in an open [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_AjakTpWBPsHc3DGdV3h8p65QYEY6EE9gqkwiHeOdUw). The phoneme error rates on the TIMIT corpus have been collected from the following three sources: *Lopes & Perdigao 2011*, ["the wer are we" github repo](https://github.com/syhw/wer_are_we) and *Mohaed, Dahl & Hinton, 2011*. Feel free to improve and correct the data.



Here is a plot of the data, the dotted line shows what is the best error rates reached by year:
